## Overview

Agent Notify is a local notification layer for AI agents. It detects installed agents, installs their official hook or plugin integration, and sends a native notification or a configured bot message when a task needs attention, finishes, or fails.

It supports **Claude Code, Codex, WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, ZCode, Grok, Droid, and OpenCode**. Delivery channels include **system notifications, Feishu / Lark, WeChat, WeChat Work, DingTalk, Bark, ntfy, and Slack**.

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx agent-notify
```

This opens the CLI setup wizard and installs only the agents and channels you select. The Bun launcher downloads the matching Go Hook Runtime into `~/.agent-notify/` and executes it by absolute path.

## How It Works

```text
Agent event
  -> host Hook / plugin
  -> native system notification + configured bot channels
  -> Docker Bridge (best-effort event history for the desktop app)
```

The host runtime is the delivery path. Notifications continue to work when Docker or the desktop app is stopped. Docker is a local control plane, not a relay that can become a single point of failure.

## Desktop App and Docker

The macOS desktop app is a source-built, menu-bar control panel. On launch it detects installed agents, installs missing user-level integrations, enables system notifications for connected agents, manages remote bot channels, shows event history, tests delivery, and controls login startup.

```bash
./deploy.sh up       # start the Bridge on 127.0.0.1:45173
./deploy.sh desktop  # build, update, and show Agent Notify.app
./deploy.sh status
```

The app is signed ad-hoc for local use and is not notarized for public macOS distribution. `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml` remains the configuration authority; the app mirrors it to the Bridge when online.

WorkBuddy caches hooks inside its `codebuddy --serve` process. Restart WorkBuddy after adding or updating its hooks.

### Agent Integrations

| Agent | Integration | Events |
|------|------|------|
| Claude Code | Native hooks | Permission, input, completion, failure |
| Codex | Official hooks | Permission and completion; run `/hooks` to trust it |
| WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy | CodeBuddy-compatible hooks | Permission, input, completion, failure; restart after changes |
| Hermes Agent | Gateway hook directory | Start, completion, failure, approval |
| OpenClaw | ESM extension | Completion, failure, approval; enable the extension in OpenClaw |
| ZCode | Native hooks | Permission, completion, failure |
| Grok | Native hooks | Permission/input classification, completion, failure |
| Droid | Native hooks | Permission/input classification and completion |
| OpenCode | JavaScript plugin | Permission, input, completion, failure |

Notes:

- Claude Code subscribes via hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`: `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `PostToolUseFailure`, and `SessionStart`.
- Codex subscribes via `~/.codex/hooks.json`: `PermissionRequest` and `Stop` (mapped to `permission_required` / `run_completed`), plus `SessionStart`. `input_required` and `run_failed` have no corresponding Codex hook yet, so they are not supported.
- ZCode subscribes via `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`: `SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, and `Stop`, mapped to `permission_required`, `run_failed`, and `run_completed`. ZCode has no `Notification` event (so no `input_required`), and its hook schema is strict — an unknown event name will cause the whole hooks config to be silently dropped.
- Grok subscribes via `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`: `SessionStart`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `PostToolUseFailure`. There is no dedicated `PermissionRequest` event; `Notification`s with permission/approval semantics map to `permission_required` (marked *), others map to `input_required`. `StopFailure` / `PostToolUseFailure` map to `run_failed`.
- Droid subscribes via `~/.factory/hooks.json`: `SessionStart`, `Notification`, `Stop`, mapped to `session_start` / `permission_required`|`input_required` / `run_completed`. Droid has no failure event, so `run_failed` is not supported. `session_start` is only used for click-to-focus window capture, not as a notification event.
- OpenCode uses a JS plugin instead of native hooks: the plugin is written to `~/.agent-notify/opencode-plugin.js` (binary path baked into JS), and its path is registered in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (user) or `./opencode.json` (project) `plugin` array. The plugin subscribes to `session.created`→`session_start`, `permission.asked`→`permission_required`, `session.status`(idle)→`input_required`, `session.idle`→`run_completed`, `session.error`→`run_failed`.
- WorkBuddy uses the CodeBuddy settings schema at `~/.codebuddy/settings.json`.
- Hermes writes `~/.hermes/hooks/agent-notify/HOOK.yaml` and `handler.py`; this is its Gateway event surface.
- OpenClaw writes a self-contained extension to `~/.openclaw/extensions/agent-notify/`. OpenClaw still controls whether that extension is enabled and granted conversation access.
- **`SessionStart` does not produce a notification.** It is subscribed on every agent solely to capture the terminal window at session start, which powers Linux window-level [Click-to-Focus](#click-to-focus). On macOS/Windows the SessionStart hook is a no-op.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Hook Runtime | Desktop control panel |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| Linux amd64 / arm64 | ✅ | — |
| Windows amd64 / arm64 | ✅ | — |

### Click-to-Focus

System notifications are clickable — clicking one brings you back to the terminal / window where the agent is running. Behavior differs by platform:

- **macOS** — App-level by default (activates the agent's terminal/IDE app). For window-level focus (return to the exact window even when several are open), set `AGENT_NOTIFY_FOCUS_PRECISION=window` in your login shell environment (e.g. `~/.zshrc`); this uses a bundled helper and requires Accessibility permission. Unset stays app-level.
- **Linux (X11)** — Window-level. The exact terminal window is captured at session start (via the `SessionStart` hook) and re-focused on click, so it distinguishes sibling windows of single-process terminals (deepin-terminal, GNOME Terminal, etc.). Native Wayland windows can't be targeted.
- **Windows** — Returns to the terminal window via a bundled helper.

> **`AGENT_NOTIFY_FOCUS_PRECISION`** accepts `window` (window-level) or `app` (app-level — the default). Values are case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed; anything unset or unrecognized falls back to `app`. This variable **only affects macOS** — Linux is always window-level, and Windows uses its own helper.

Click-to-focus is enabled by default for the System channel; the target app/window is detected automatically from the hook's environment and process tree.




## Configuration

On first run, the launcher downloads the platform-specific binary matching the current Bun package version from GitHub Releases and installs it to:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.agent-notify/agent-notify`
- Windows: `~/.agent-notify/agent-notify.exe`

On every subsequent run it checks the local binary version: it downloads if missing, updates if outdated, and otherwise runs directly. The launcher never persistently modifies `PATH` — it always executes via an absolute path.

> **Note**: Codex integrates through the official hooks system in `~/.codex/hooks.json` and currently subscribes only to `PermissionRequest` and `Stop`. After first install, run `/hooks` inside Codex to complete the trust review.
>
> **Grok**: Writes `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`. Global hooks are always trusted; project hooks (`.grok/hooks/`) require `/hooks-trust` or `--trust`. After install, run `/hooks` (or `Ctrl+L`) inside Grok to confirm they loaded.


> You don't need to edit config files by hand — this section is for reference only.

Agent Notify's own config lives at `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml`. **New installs start with all agents and channels disabled** — run `bunx agent-notify` (setup wizard) once to enable the agents and channels you want. This avoids showing unconfigured agents as ready in view/doctor after a partial setup. Existing config files are left unchanged.

Agent integration config locations:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/settings.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-claude-hook`)
- Codex: `~/.codex/hooks.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-codex-hook`; run `/hooks` inside Codex to complete trust)
- ZCode: `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` (writes `hooks.events.<Event>` + `hooks.enabled` → command `agent-notify handle-zcode-hook`; restart ZCode for the config to take effect)
- Grok: `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-grok-hook`; project scope uses `.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`)
- Droid: `~/.factory/hooks.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-droid-hook`; project scope uses `.factory/hooks.json`)
- OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (writes `plugin` array → `~/.agent-notify/opencode-plugin.js`, command `agent-notify handle-opencode-hook`; project scope uses `./opencode.json`)
- WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy: `~/.codebuddy/settings.json` (writes `handle-workbuddy-hook`)
- Hermes Agent: `~/.hermes/hooks/agent-notify/` (writes a Gateway hook manifest and handler)
- OpenClaw: `~/.openclaw/extensions/agent-notify/` (writes an ESM extension)

Remote channels are configured once under `remote` in `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml` and shared by enabled agents. Agent-level event choices still decide which events are sent.

### WeChat Work Bot Binding Tip

1. **Create a single-person notification group**: start a group chat in WeChat Work (pull in a few colleagues). After it's created, **do not post anything**, then remove the others — the group becomes your personal notification channel.
2. **Add a bot**: "Group Settings" → "Message Push" → "Add" → "Custom Message Push", name it and save.
3. **Get the webhook URL**: copy the generated URL, which looks like `https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/webhook/send?key=xxx`.
4. **Bind it**: run `bunx agent-notify`, enable the WeChat Work channel in the setup wizard, and paste the webhook URL.
> Older WeChat Work versions: "Group Settings" → "Group Bots" → "Add Bot" → "New Bot", name it and save.
